## ORGANIZATION DATA CHALLENGES

The world of business is data-focused and organizations are continuously assessing and adopting new technologies and information management practices. With the IT landscape continuing to evolve, it gets even more difficult to ensure that the right data is at the right place, at the right time.

Data is constantly being generated through diverse platforms and the source of data for any organisation is no longer exclusive to traditional applications. Implementing strategies to manage data and drive business requirements is a challenging task and often there are no fixed remedies to handle data related issues.



## DATA INSIGHTS – ROT ANALYSIS DASHBOARD

Organizational data is growing at a rapid pace of around 40-60% each year forcing organizations to invest in additional storage capacity. But as capacity is expanded, Redundant, Obsolete, and Trivial user data is clogging corporate networks resulting in unnecessary risk and expense.


## DATA INSIGHTS – PII DISCOVERY

Organizations are constantly creating, storing, and managing data that could be classified as sensitive information or PII. PII is any data that can be used to identify an individual like personal identity, bank details, email, phone number, or insurance details.

This creates a liability to fines, penalties, and breaches that are associated with several industries.

HIDO PII discovery helps organizations in identifying and locating sensitive data to assist IT teams in protecting or removing any pieces of compromising information.

## MIGRATION FACTORY

Migration Factory allows to connect with various data sources like SharePoint, IBM CMOD, NAS, CIFS, OpenText, ZL etc and perform intelligent data transfer to HCP or other target locations.

Besides standard connectors, other custom connectors can be developed based on business requirements.
